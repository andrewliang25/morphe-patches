/**
 * Helper for the "[General] AMOLED black theme" patch. It answers the first of the three routes
 * that a colour takes. See {@code docs/facebook-theme-map.md}.
 *
 * <p>The decision needs the token, because a colour alone cannot show the difference between a card
 * and a dark divider. The names of the tokens carry that difference, and R8 cannot rename an enum
 * constant.
 *
 * <p>The decision also needs the colour, because the same tokens serve light mode, where a card is
 * white. Thus the patch needs no test for dark mode.
 *
 * <p>{@link #apply} runs for each colour on each layout pass. Thus it makes no object, loads no
 * class and writes no log.
